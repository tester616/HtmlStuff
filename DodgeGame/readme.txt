A small game where your objective is to survive for as long as possible. If health reaches 0 it's game over.

Mechanics:
- Your ball is drawn to the position of your mouse pointer based on the distance between the two.
- Contact with red enemy balls damages you.
- You have access to a shield which absorbs a portion of incoming damage, but increases your total size the more of it you have.
- You can collect spawning powerups and use them against your enemies to survive longer.
- Enemies can also use powerups against you if they come in contact with them, so collecting them fast is an important factor for long survival.

powerups:
- (A) Size		--> You and enemies shrink in size, collecting enemies get bigger.
- (S) Speed		--> Enemies slow down, collecting enemies speed up.
- (D) Magnetism		--> You repel incoming enemies in an aura around you based on distance, collecting enemies draw you in.
- (Z) Shock		--> You damage enemies around you after a countdown, collecting enemies can do the same to you.
- (X) Invulnerability	--> You become immune to all damage for a brief moment and can damage enemies by collision, collecting enemies become immune to your attacks

Shield:
- Has two modes, growing and not growing
- Toggle between the modes with Ctrl
- growing mode gives you more shields over time but slows you down

Additional stuff:
- Pressing Space instantly sets your speed to 0. Can be used to more easily navigate the field, but is considered cheating in a way.
- Pressing T pauses the game, but was never fully implemented, so things like real-time countdowns still continue and can cause problems.
